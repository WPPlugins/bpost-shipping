**Features**

Based on the bpost Shipping Manager account settings :

* display allowed delivery methods

**Usage notice**

bpost shipping is not allowed and will display an error message:

* if total weight of the order is above 30 kgs or the equivalent in OZ
* if cash on delivery payment mode is selected

bpost shipping supports:

* free shipping coupons from standard Woocommerce feature - NOT requiring that "Free delivery" method is active!
* free shipping for some shopping cart amount AND/OR some countries (to be defined in bpost shipping settings in Woocommerce) - in this case, shipping costs defined in bpost Shipping Manager backend are overriden

bpost shipping does NOT take into account the Woocommerce "shipping classes", nor the VAT/taxes configured to apply on the shipping costs.
Indeed: shipping costs are always "VAT 21% inclusive" in bpost Shipping Manager backend.

bpost shipping costs depending on the parcels weight are managed through the values defined in bpost Shipping Manager backend, and all prices are (belgian) taxes included.
